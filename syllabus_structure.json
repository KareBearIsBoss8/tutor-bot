  "Section 1.1: Propositional logic": "Every mathematical proof is written in the context of certain assumptions being made,\nand certain goals to be achieved.\n\u2022Assumptions are the propositions which are known to be true, or which we are as-\nsuming to be true for the purposes of proving something. They include theorems\nthat have already been proved, prior knowledge which is assumed of the reader, and\nassumptions which are explicitly made using words like \u2018suppose\u2019 or \u2018assume\u2019.\n\u2022Goals are the propositions we are trying to prove in order to complete the proof of a\nresult, or perhaps just a step in the proof.\nWith every phrase we write, our assumptions and goals change. This is perhaps best\nillustrated by example. In Example 1.1.1 below, we will examine the proof of Proposi-\ntion 0.16 in detail, so that we can see how the words we wrote affected the assumptions\nand goals at each stage in the proof. We will indicate our assumptions and goals at\nany given stage using tables\u2014the assumptions listed will only be those assumptions\nwhich are made explicitly; prior knowledge and previously proved theorems will be\nleft implicit.\n\u2710Example 1.1.1\nThe statement of Proposition 0.16 was as follows:\nLeta,b,c\u2208Z. Ifcdivides bandbdivides a, then cdivides a.\nThe set-up of the proposition instantly gives us our initial assumptions and goals:\nAssumptions Goals\na,b,c\u2208ZIfcdivides bandbdivides a, then c\ndivides a\nWe will now proceed through the proof, line by line, to see what effect the words we\nwrote had on the assumptions and goals.\nSince our goal was an expression of the form \u2018if. . . then. . . \u2019, it made sense to start by\nassuming the \u2018if\u2019 statement, and using that assumption to prove the \u2018then\u2019 statement.\nAs such, the first thing we wrote in our proof was:\nSuppose that cdivides bandbdivides a.\n26\nSection 1.1. Propositional logic 27\nOur updated assumptions and goals are reflected in the following table.\nAssumptions Goals\na,b,c\u2208Z cdivides a\ncdivides b\nbdivides a\nOur next step in the proof was to unpack the definitions of \u2018 cdivides b\u2019 and \u2018 bdivides\na\u2019, giving us more to work with.\nSuppose that cdivides bandbdivides a. By Definition 0.13, it follows that\nb=qc and a=rb\nfor some integers qandr.\nThis introduces two new variables q,rand allows us to replace the assumptions \u2018 c\ndivides b\u2019 and \u2018 bdivides a\u2019 with their definitions.\nAssumptions Goals\na,b,c,q,r\u2208Z cdivides a\nb=qc\na=rb\nAt this point we have pretty much exhausted all of the assumptions we can make, and\nso our attention turns towards the goal\u2014that is, we must prove that cdivides a. At this\npoint, it helps to \u2018work backwards\u2019 by unpacking the goal: what does it mean for cto\ndivide a? Well, by Definition 0.13, we need to prove that ais equal to some integer\nmultiplied by c\u2014this will be reflected in the following table of assumptions and goals.\nSince we are now trying to express ain terms of c, it makes sense to use the equations\nwe have relating awith b, and bwith c, to relate awith c.\nSuppose that cdivides bandbdivides a.

For example,\nconsider the following statement:\nxis divisible by 7\nThis statement seems like the kind of thing we should probably be able to work with if\nwe\u2019re doing mathematics. It makes sense if xis a integer, such as 28 or 41; but it doesn\u2019t\nmake sense at all if xis a parrot called Alex.[a]In any case, even when it does make\nsense, its truth value depends on x; indeed, \u201828 is divisible by 7\u2019 is a true proposition,\nbut \u201841 is divisible by 7\u2019 is a false proposition.\nThis means that the statement \u2018 xis divisible by 7\u2019 isn\u2019t a proposition\u2014 quel horreur !\nBut it almost is a proposition: if we know that xrefers somehow to an integer, then it\nbecomes a proposition as soon as a particular numerical value of xis specified. The\nsymbol xis called a free variable .\n\u2726Definition 1.2.1\nLetxbe a variable that is understood to refer to an element of a set X. In a statement\ninvolving x, we say xisfree if it makes sense to substitute particular elements of Xin\nthe statement; otherwise, we say xisbound .\nTo represent statements that have free variables in them abstractly, we generalise the\nnotion of a propositional variable (Definition 1.1.2) to that of a predicate .\n\u2726Definition 1.2.2\nApredicate is a symbol ptogether with a specified list of free variables x1,x2,..., xn\n(where n\u2208N) and, for each free variable xi, a specification of a set Xicalled the domain\nof discourse (orrange ) ofxi. We will typically write p(x1,x2,..., xn)in order to make\nthe variables explicit.\n[a]Alex the parrot is the only non-human animal to have ever been observed to ask an existential question;\nhe died in September 2007 so we may never know if he was divisible by 7, but it is unlikely.

The reader is advised to finish\ncrying before they continue reading about variables and quantifiers.\n49\n50 Chapter 1. Logical structure\nThe statements represented by predicates are those that become propositions when spe-\ncific values are substituted for their free variables from their respective domains of\ndiscourse. For example, \u2018 xis divisible by 7\u2019 is not a proposition, but it becomes a\nproposition when specific integers (such as 28 or 41) are substituted for x.\nThis is a lot to take in, so let\u2019s look at some examples.\n\u2710Example 1.2.3\n(i) We can represent the statement \u2018 xis divisible by 7\u2019 discussed above by a predicate\np(x)whose only free variable xhasZas its domain of discourse. Then p(28)is\nthe true proposition \u201828 is divisible by 7\u2019 and p(41)is the false proposition \u201841 is\ndivisible by 7\u2019.\n(ii) A predicate with no free variables is precisely a propositional variable. This\nmeans that the notion of a predicate generalises that of a propositional variable.\n(i",

  "Section 2.1: Sets": "We begin by redefining the notion of a setwith a notch more precision than we provided\nin Chapter 0. At their core, sets seem extremely simple\u2014sets are just collections of\nobjects\u2014except that if not kept in check, this characterisation of a set leads to logical\ninconsistencies, such as the infamous Russell\u2019s paradox .\nThese logical paradoxes can be overcome by restricting ourselves to working inside a\nuniverse U, which we consider to be a set which is so big that it contains all of the\nmathematical objects that we want to talk about. This is a subtle issue, which is well\nbeyond the scope of this section, but is discussed further in Section B.1.\n\u2726Definition 2.1.1\nAsetis a collection of elements from a specified universe of discourse . The collection\nof everything in the universe of discourse is called the universal set , denoted by U\n(LATEX code:\\mathcal{U} ).\nThe expression x\u2208X(LATEX code:\\in) denotes the statement that xis an element of\nX; we write x\u0338\u2208X(LATEX code:\\not\\in ) to mean \u00ac(x\u2208X), that is that xis not an\nelement of X.\n\u2710Example 2.1.2\nIn Chapter 0, we introduced five sets: the set Nof natural numbers, the set Zof integers,\nthe set Qof rational numbers, the set Rof real numbers and the set Cof complex\nnumbers. \u25c1\n\u270eExercise 2.1.3\nWhich of the following propositions are true, and which are false?\n1\n2\u2208Z1\n2\u2208Q Z \u2208Q Z \u2208U1\n2\u2208U\n\u25c1\nWe will avoid referring explicitly to the universal set Uwhenever possible, but it will\nalways be there in the background. This is convenient because we no longer need to\nworry about the domain of discourse of free variables (as we did in Definition 1.2.2), so\nthat we can abbreviate \u2018 \u2200x\u2208U,p(x)\u2019 by \u2018\u2200x,p(x)\u2019, and \u2018 \u2203x\u2208U,p(x)\u2019 by \u2018\u2203x,p(x)\u2019.\nNote that under this convention:\n\u2022\u2200x\u2208X,p(x)is logically equivalent to \u2200x,(x\u2208X\u21d2p(x)); and\n\u2022\u2203x\u2208X,p(x)is logically equivalent to \u2203x,(x\u2208X\u2227p(x)).\n86\nSection 2.1. Sets 87\nSpecifying a set\nOne way of defining a set is simply to describe it in words, like we have done up to\nnow. There are other, more concise ways of specifying sets, which also remove such\nambiguity from the process.\nLists. One way is simply to provide a listof the elements of the set. To specify that\nthe list denotes a set, we enclose the list with {curly brackets }(LATEX code:\\{,\\} ).\nFor example, the following is a specification of a set X, whose elements are the natural\nnumbers between 0 and 5 (inclusive):\nX={0,1,2,3,4,5}\nImplied lists. Sometimes a list might be too long to write out\u2014maybe even infinite\u2014or\nthe length of the list might depend on a variable. In these cases it will be convenient to\nuse an implied list , in which some elements of the list are written, and the rest are left\nimplicit by writing an ellipsis \u2018 ...\u2019 (LATEX code:\\dots ). For example, the statement\nX={1,4,9,..., n2}\nmeans that Xis the set whose elements are all the square numbers from 1 to n2, where n\nis some number. Implied lists can be ambiguous, since they rely on the reader\u2019s ability\nto infer the pattern being followed, so use with caution!\nSet-buil",

   "Section 3.1: Functions": "One way of studying interactions between sets is by studying functions between them,\nwhich we will define informally in Definition 3.1.1. Functions are mathematical objects\nwhich assign to each element of one set exactly one element of another. Almost every\nbranch of mathematics studies functions, be it directly or indirectly, and almost every\napplication of mathematics arises from a translation of the abstract notion of a function\nto the real world. Just one example of this is the theory of computation\u2014functions\nprovide precisely the language necessary to describe the deterministic input-output be-\nhaviour of algorithms.\nYou might have come across the notion of a function before now. In schools, functions\nare often introduced as being like machines \u2014they have inputs and outputs, and on a\ngiven input they always return the same output. For instance, there is a function which\ntakes integers as inputs and gives integers as outputs, which on the input xreturns the\ninteger x+3.\nThis characterisation of functions, however, is clearly not precise enough for the pur-\nposes of mathematical proof.

So let\u2019s try\nto make this more precise:\nA set X is finite if the elements of X can be listed one by one\nin such a way that the list has both a start and an end.\nThis is better but is still not entirely precise\u2014it is not entirely clear what is meant by\n\u2018listed one by one\u2019. But we can make this precise. Let\u2019s label the positions in our list\nwith natural numbers. To list the elements of Xmeans to specify an element of Xto\ngo in position 0, then another element of Xto go in position 1, and so on, until we\neventually run out of elements of X\u2014the fact that we eventually run out of elements is\nexactly what we want to capture by our definition of \u2018finite\u2019.\nIf the listed elements of Xoccupy positions 0 ,1,..., n\u22121, this means that we have\neffectively paired up the elements of [n](the list positions) with the elements of X(the\nset being listed). Since \u2018pairing up\u2019 really means \u2018finding a bijection\u2019, we are now ready\nto define what it means for a set to be finite.\n214\nSection 6.1.

  "Section 6.2: Countable and uncountable sets": "In Section 6.1, we defined what it means for a set to be \u2018finite\u2019 in order to capture the\nidea that its elements can be listed in such a way that the list has a start and an end. We\ndid so by observing that a list of the elements of a finite set is essentially the same thing\nas a bijection f:[n]\u2192Xfor some n\u2208N, with the element f(k)\u2208Xplaying the role of\nthe element in position kin the list.\nWe are now interested in infinite sets. We certainly can\u2019t expect a list of all the elements\nof an infinite set to end, so the question now is: can its elements be listed if we allow\nthe list to be infinite? We will call such sets countable sets .\nIt is perhaps surprising that not every set is countable: some sets are \u2018too big\u2019 for their\nelements to be listed! We will prove that such uncountable sets exist later in this section.\nThe precise definition of what it means for a set Xto be countable (Definition 6.2.1)\ncaptures the idea that we can list the elements of Xone-by-one such that, even if the\nlist goes on forever, each element of Xappears at some finite stage in the list. The list\nmight or might not be finite; it has a start, but it might not have an end.\nTo illustrate, consider the following list of the elements of N:\n0,1,2,3,4, ..., n,n+1, ...\nThe list does not end, since Nis infinite (Theorem 6.1.25), but nevertheless every nat-\nural number appears at some finite stage along the list.\nAs another example, consider the set Zof all integers. We might wish to list the ele-\nments of Zin the usual way:\n...,\u2212(n+1),\u2212n, ...,\u22123,\u22122,\u22121,0,1,2,3, ..., n,n+1, ...\nThis does not fulfil our criterion that the list must have a start: it is infinite in both\ndirections. However, it is still possible to list them, by slotting the negative integers\nin-between the non-negative integers:\n0,\u22121,1,\u22122,2,\u22123,3, ...,\u2212n,n,\u2212(n+1),n+1, ...\nThis is not how we would usually think about listing the integers, but we have nonethe-\nless found a way of doing it so that every integer appears at some finite stage on the\nlist.\nBut specifying a list of the elements of an infinite set X, such that every element of X\nappears at some finite stage on the list, is equivalent to specifying a bijection f:N\u2192X,\n224\nSection 6.2. Countable and uncountable sets 225\nwhere the element f(k)\u2208Xplays the role of the element in position kof the list\u2014that\nis, the elements of Xcan be listed as\nf(0),f(1),f(2), ..., f(n),f(n+1), ...\nThis motivates the following definition.\n\u2726Definition 6.2.1\nA set Xiscountably infinite if there exists a bijection f:N\u2192X.

  "Section 7.1: Division": "This section introduces the notion of divisibility . As we have already mentioned, it\nis not always the case that one integer can divide another.

  "Section 11.1: Discrete probability spaces": "Probability theory is a field of mathematics which attempts to model randomness and\nuncertainty in the \u2018real world\u2019. The mathematical machinery it develops allows us to\nunderstand how this randomness behaves and to extract information which is useful for\nmaking predictions.\nDiscrete probability theory, in particular, concerns situations in which the possible out-\ncomes form a countable set. This simplifies matters considerably: if there are only\ncountably many outcomes, then the probability that any event occurs is determined\nentirely by the probabilities that the individual outcomes comprised by the event occur.\nFor example, the number Nof words spoken by a child over the course of a year takes\nvalues in N, so is discrete. To each n\u2208N, we may assign a probability that N=n,\nwhich can take positive values in a meaningful way, and from these probabilities we\ncan compute the probabilities of more general events occurring (e.g. the probability\nthat the child says under a million words). However, the height Hgrown by the child\nover the same period takes values in [0,\u221e), which is uncountable; for each h\u2208[0,\u221e),\nthe probability that H=his zero, so these probabilities give us no information. We\nmust study the behaviour of Hthrough some other means.\nIn this chapter, we will concern ourselves only with the discrete setting.\nIt is important to understand from the outset that, although we use language like\noutcome ,event ,probability andrandom , and although we use real-world examples,\neverything we do concerns mathematical objects: sets, elements of sets, and functions.\nIf we say, for example, \u201cthe probability that a roll of a fair six-sided die shows 3 or 4\nis1\n3,\u201d we are actually interpreting the situation mathematically\u2014the outcomes of the\ndie rolls are interpreted as the elements of the set {1,2,3,4,5,6}; the event that the die\nshows 3 or 4 is interpreted as the subset {3,4} \u2286 { 1,2,3,4,5,6}; and the probability\nthat this event occurs is the value of a particular function P:P({1,2,3,4,5,6})\u2192[0,1]\non input {3,4}. The mathematical interpretation is called a model of the real-world\nsituation.\n436\nSection 11.1. Discrete probability spaces 437\n\u2726Definition 11.1.1\nAdiscrete probability space is a pair (\u2126,P)(LATEX code:(\\Omega, \\mathbb{P}) ),\nconsisting of a countable set \u2126and a function P:P(\u2126)\u2192[0,1], such that\n(i)P(\u2126) =1; and\n(ii) ( Countable additivity ) If{Ai|i\u2208I}is any family of pairwise disjoint subsets\nof\u2126, indexed by a countable set I, then\nP \n[\ni\u2208IAi!\n=\u2211\ni\u2208IP(Ai)\nThe set \u2126is called the sample space ; the elements \u03c9\u2208\u2126are called outcomes ;athe\nsubsets A\u2286\u2126are called events ; and the function Pis called the probability measure .\nGiven an event A, the value P(A)is called the probability of A.\naThe symbols \u2126,\u03c9(LATEX code: \\Omega,\\omega ) are the upper- and lower-case forms, respectively, of the\nGreek letter omega .\nThere is a general notion of a probability space, which does not require the sample\nspace \u2126to be countable. This definition is significantly more t",
  "Section 11.2: Discrete random variables": "Events in a probability space are sometimes unenlightening when looked at in isolation.\nFor example, suppose we roll a fair six-sided die twice. The outcomes are elements of\nthe set \u2126={1,2,3,4,5,6}2, each occurring with equal probability1\n36. The event that\nthe die rolls sum to 7 is precisely the subset\n{(1,6),(2,5),(3,4),(4,3),(5,2),(6,1)} \u2286\u2126\nand so we can say that the probability that the two rolls sum to 7 is\nP({(1,6),(2,5),(3,4),(4,3),(5,2),(6,1)}) =1\n6\nHowever, it is not at all clear from the expression {(1,6),(2,5),(3,4),(4,3),(5,2),(6,1)}\nthat, when we wrote it down, what we had in mind was the event that the sum of the\ndie rolls is 7. Moreover, the expression of the event in this way does not make it clear\nhow to generalise to other possible sums of die rolls.\nNote that the sum of the die rolls defines a function S:\u2126\u2192N, defined by\nS(a,b) =a+bfor all (a,b)\u2208\u2126\nThe function Sallows us to express our event in a more enlightening way: indeed,\n{(1,6),(2,5),(3,4),(4,3),(5,2),(6,1)}={(a,b)\u2208\u2126|a+b=7}=S\u22121[{7}]\n(Recall the definition of preimage in Definition 3.1.37.) Thus the probability that the\nsum of the two die rolls is 7 is equal to P(S\u22121[{7}]).\nIf we think of Snot as a function \u2126\u2192N, but as a N-valued random variable , which\nvaries according to a random outcome in \u2126, then we can informally say\nP{S=7}=1\n6which formally means P(S\u22121[{7}]) =1\n6\nThis affords us much more generality. Indeed, we could ask what the probability is\nthat the die rolls sum to a value greater than or equal to 7. In this case, note that\nthe die rolls (a,b)sum to a number greater than or equal to 7 if and only if a+b\u2208\n{7,8,9,10,11,12}, which occurs if and only if (a,b)\u2208S\u22121[{7,8,9,10,11,12}].

In this\ncase, we might informally say\nP{Sis prime }=5\n12which formally means P(S\u22121[{2,3,5,7,11}]) =5\n12\nand so on. In each of these cases, we\u2019re defining events\u2014which are subsets of the\nsample space\u2014in terms of conditions on the values of a random variable (which is,\nformally, a function).\nWe make the above intuition formal in Definition 11.2.1.\n\u2726Definition 11.2.1\nLet(\u2126,P)be a probability space and let Ebe a set.

A random variable with countable\nstate space is called a discrete random variable .\nBefore we proceed with examples, some notation for events regarding values of random\nvariables will be particularly useful.\n\u2726Notation 11.2.2\nLet(\u2126,P)be a probability space, let Ebe a set and let Xbe an E-valued random\nvariable on (\u2126,P).

  "Section 12.2: Inductively defined sets": "In Section 4.1, we formalised the idea that the set of natural numbers should be what is\nobtained by starting with zero and repeating the successor (\u2018plus one\u2019) operation\u2014this\nwas done using Peano\u2019s axioms (Definition 4.1.1). From these axioms we were able\nto derive the weak and strong induction principles, which turned out to be extremely\npowerful for proving results about natural numbers.\nWe now generalise this idea to other so-called inductively defined sets. The definition\n(Definition 12.2.9) is a little tricky to digest, but the idea is relatively simple: an induct-\nively defined set Xis one whose elements are built out of some specified basic elements\n(such as 0) by iterating some specified operations, called constructors (such as the suc-\ncessor operation)\u2014every element of Xshould either be a basic element, or should be\nbuilt in a unique way out of simpler elements of Xby using a constructor.\nEach inductively defined set Xwill have its own induction principle: which says that if\na property is true of all of the basic elements of X, and if all of its constructors preserve\nthe truth of the property, then the property is true of all of the elements of X. We will\nprove this in Theorem 12.2.28.\nBefore jumping into the definition of an inductively defined set, it is helpful to see some\nexamples. The first example is familiar.\n\u2710Example 12.2.1\nThe set Nof natural numbers is thecanonical example of an inductively defined set.\nThe Peano axioms (Definition 4.1.1) tell us that every element of Ncan be obtained by\nstarting from 0 and applying the successor operation (\u2018plus one\u2019) some finite number\nof times. In particular, every natural number is either 0, or is the successor of a unique\nnatural number.\nWe can think of Nas being the set generated by the following rules:\n(i) 0\u2208N; and\n(ii) If n\u2208N, then n+1\u2208N.\nCertainly these rules are true, but that is not enough to fully characterise the set of\nnatural numbers: both rules are also true with Nreplaced by ZorR, for example.\nBut what it means to say that Nis \u2018generated by\u2019 these rules is that:\n\u2022 Each time one of the rules is applied, we obtain a newnatural number. In particular:\n486\nSection 12.2. Inductively defined sets 487\n\u22c4Since 0 \u2208Nand rule (ii) must give us a new natural number every time we apply\nit, we must have n+1\u0338=0 for all n\u2208N. This is exactly what Definition 4.1.1(i)\nsays; note that this fails with Nreplaced by ZorRsince we have (\u22121)+1=0.\n\u22c4If we apply rule (ii) to two different natural numbers, we must obtain two different\nresults. Thus for all m,n\u2208N, ifm+1=n+1, then m=n. This is exactly what\nDefinition 4.1.1(ii) says.\n\u2022 Only those things that can be obtained by applying rules (i) and (ii) some finite num-\nber of times are natural numbers. This is exactly what Definition 4.1.1(iii) says.\nThus we can think of the natural numbers as being precisely those things that are given\nto us by applying rules (i) and (ii). \u25c1\nThe next example concerns words over an alphabet, which we studied in Section 6.2 i"
